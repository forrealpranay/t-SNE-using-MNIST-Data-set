# t-SNE-using-MNIST-Data-set
This project demonstrates the application of t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for visualizing high-dimensional data from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each represented as a 784-dimensional vector.
